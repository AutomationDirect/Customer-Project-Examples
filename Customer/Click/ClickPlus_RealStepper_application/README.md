# Precision Rubber Keyway Cutting Machine

## Overview

This project involves the development of a machine that uses three stepper motors to precisely cut a keyway in rubber pieces. The machine is designed to achieve a tolerance of less than one degree, ensuring highly accurate cuts. The project was completed last year and utilizes various function blocks from the Click Software provided by Automation Direct.

## Project Background

The goal of this project was to create a cost-effective solution for cutting keyways in rubber pieces with high precision. The machine leverages the capabilities of the Click PLC Plus, which offers three axes for motion control, along with a fast input/output expansion module. (This contribution also contains a image of the machine for context)

## Software Components

- Click Software (Automation Direct)

## Key Features

- Utilizes all three axes available in the Click PLC Plus for motion control
- Incorporates a fast input/output expansion module for efficient data handling
- Implements various function blocks from the Click Software to achieve precise motion control
- Achieves a tolerance of less than one degree for highly accurate keyway cuts (software adjustments and a lot work with the available hardware from Automation direct)

## Purpose

The primary purpose of sharing this project is to provide a practical example of using the Click PLC Plus and its associated software for motion control applications. By showcasing the approach taken in this project, it aims to assist others who may be facing challenges or seeking guidance in implementing motion control systems with Automation Direct products.
